# N-Body Simulation

### OpenCL accelerated N-Body Simulation
* Supports 10,000 - 30,000 realtime entities depending on GPU (based on current tests)
* Brute force approach using a modified version of Newtons Law of Gravity

### (WORK IN PROGRESS)
- Converting to a barnes hut / octree approach
- Likely switching to a 3d simulation depending on results of the above
- Add density coloring (more particles/force in an area will result in different coloring)
- Add visual
